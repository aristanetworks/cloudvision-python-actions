# This script is far less complex than inbuilt CVP one and simply Enters and Exits BGP MM
# for the unit System, regardless of traffic counters/etc.

# Why use this instead of built-in BGP MM script?
# The built-in BGP MM script actions contain a number of tests to see if entering MM was successful
# (keeps track of traffic volumes, whether BGP neighbors come up after reboot, etc.)
# These complexities make the built-in scripts hard to use in many real-world scenarios where one
# may have orphan ports causing minimum traffic thresholds to never be reached. This means the
# actions are prone to failure.
# This custom script does not include any of the tests, making it easier to use in scenarios where
# you have orphan ports or other conditions that are causing minimum traffic thresholds to never
# be reached.
