# The MLAG check built into CVP is sometimes a little too clever for its own good.
# It checks the output of mlag config-sanity and if there are inconsistencies, the check will fail.
# This can cause issues if one wanted to use the check in an upgrade scenario where a difference
# in EOS version may cause cosmetic inconsistencies in the output. This MLAG Check simply checks
# whether there is an MLAG reload delay timer in progress and waits until it has expired
# before declaring success.
