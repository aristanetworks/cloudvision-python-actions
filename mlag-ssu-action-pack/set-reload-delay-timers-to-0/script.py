# This script is the first step in the workflow used to perform a hitless upgrade.
# It checks whether or not a switch is a member of an MLAG pair and if so, will set the reload delay timers
# of the switch to 0 in order to prevent interfaces from going into an errdisabled state after 'reload'
# which prevents traffic to/from single homed hosts from being dropped.
